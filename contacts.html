            <h2>Note</h2>
            <p>
                I'm always open to work with competent people who care about
                quality <strong>but</strong>...
            </p>
            <p>
                I receive tons of emails from people who find me via LinkedIn.
                Most of them haven't even looked at my profile. They just
                believe they can contact you, ask for your CV without telling a
                single word about the potential job (as if you were going to
                accept just anything), pass the CV to someone else (likely other
                people who just do the same, in a chain of several middlemen)
                and earn money in return.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's unfair.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even when they are the actual employer, some of them think you
                are going to spend time with them (phone calls, etc.) without
                any idea about the prospective salary.
            </p>
            <p>
                And some of them propose me C jobs, probably due to the
                widespread idea that C and C++ are more or less the same thing,
                or jobs that contravene my fundamental ethical principles (you
                won't believe me, but, despite a list like the one that follows
                being on my LinkedIn profile, at the very start, one person
                contacted me for a C job for a weapon manufacturer).
            </p>
            <p>
                So, bear with me if I specify this little list of things that
                are no-no's for me, if only for the few individuals who will
                actually read it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please, don't contact me:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>For military applications.</li>
                <li>If the job you propose involves “consulting” companies or
                    any middleman which steals money without adding value (it's
                    OK if they are just recruiters and disappear once the work
                    relationship is established; it's not OK if they keep
                    subtracting money after that).</li>
                <li>For work in C.</li>
                <li>If you don't mention the salary range.</li>
                <li>If you can't show examples of the code you produce, before
                    the first interview (I can show examples of mine).</li>
                <li>If you plan for me to train other people (I don't like
                    teaching).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Are you still there? That's a good sign :-). My email address is
                <em>firstName</em>.<em>lastName</em>@gmail.com.
